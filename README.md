# fuji-dots

Made these dotfiles because my Ai Ohto rice was eye-straining so I had to make something that is more pleasant for everyone's eyes. Plus purple is my aesthetic. You're welcome. This is a [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org) rice.

## Pre-installation

Assuming you have a clean install of your Linux distro, execute the following command:

### For Arch-based distros

```./install-arch-deps.sh```

So far, I only tested it on Arch Linux. Hit me up with a PR if you know how to install these deps on other distros.

## Installation

Execute the following command:

```./install.sh```

Firefox CSS needs to be copy-pasted manually.
